I've already found a product out of the five Dom recomended, made a website and shopify account, and started with some ads. I am having some trouble with Auto DS. I gave Auto DS my website URL to my website,  it ended up looking a little different then how yours did on the video, but I thought I figured it out and just continued going on with the free program. You guys said that it could take up to a couple days for the website to find me the cheapest supplier. Before finishing up my website (I'm selling the vacuum sealed travel bag)  I checked all over ali express for my a rough estimate of what I should price my product at, Ali Express usually priced the bag around $45-$60, so I priced my product at $94.99.  I've been waiting for Auto DS to find the supplier and go through with my source request, but it still says its in progress. That is not the issue. I had 3 different colors for the bags on my website, black, grey ,and blue. For some reason it has gone to my website, increased the price to $117.82, gotten rid of the sale I had up, gotten rid of the other two option of black and gray, and says I'm sold out. On top of all this,  I ordered a bag off of the website before this happened,  so I could start creating adds with it. My order says it is still pending, and that I've made a -$2 profit. I paid for Trust so you guys could help me out with this and help expand my knowledge in dropshipping since I have just started. Can you guys please help a brother out? If you guys need to see pictures of what it looks like or something like that just let me know.",

I am thinking of ways to create comments and engagement. The first way I thought of was doing a series where I try different track setups with the cones that come with the car. The second was the controversy and I was going to basically mis name the te car. For example the car is a AE-86 Toyota but I would call it a supra or GTR to spark comments. Then I would basically just show off the car mislabeling anything from tires to exhause to drifting. I would need to experiment with the number of mistakes but I think it is a good starting point. Any tips for me? Or if anyone has done this before and has ideas that they want to share I would be appreciative of that.",

IG reels is already such a big part of dropshipping and I think it would only continue and grow if tiktok was no longer a thing. On top of that im 100% sure new platforms would come out which could be great opportunites for us to take advantage of. From what I now if it gets passed they have 160 days to sell tiktok to a US company which I really think would happen as so many billionaires and big companies would want it.

      "MikeChamberlin: Although I do think this product has been done quite a bit and isnt in its \"prime\" anymore I think with improved content you could boost this even further and get some traction on your website. I feel like you were onto something with the Prototype video and if you improve it I could see it doing really well. Show you putting together the prototype and make it very confusing so the viewers will stick around. Other than that in general I think just improving the lighting and everything on your videos could make a big chnage"

(not trying to be harsh just want to actually help) I see you are trying to do the prototype to finished product video but the way you are doing it is very off. You want to have the viewer confused in the start so they stick around and stay and then actually transition into the product **using the right sound.**The filming looks cheap and honestly the effort seems low almost like you got this all filmed and posted within just 30 mins. Id also assume after a month or so you are running a but low on ideas so I really really recommend watching the call recording from yesterday to see how me and dom would get a product going and how we evaluate videos.

Like I guarantee you that bro and that’s the mindset you need to have. For instance Mike and I put in almost 1 month of work marketing this discord after spending 2 weeks making all the courses and information with you guys. We spent a month and a half busting our assess on this with literally 0 results, now seemingly out of nowhere there are over 400 of you guys in here.

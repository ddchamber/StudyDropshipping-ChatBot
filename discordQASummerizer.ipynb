      "\n",
      "First, focus on highlighting what makes this product special and different. With a dishwashing robot, you'll want to showcase the convenience, time-saving benefits, and \"wow\" factor in your ads. Create eye-catching videos that demonstrate the product in action and spark curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, think about the specific pain points this solves for your target customers. Are busy families the main audience? Highlight how it frees up time for other activities. Or maybe it appeals to those who hate doing dishes - play up how it eliminates that chore.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to advertising, I'd recommend starting with a mix of organic and paid strategies. On social media, share educational content that teaches people about the product and its use cases. Run targeted Facebook and Instagram ads to reach the right customers. You can also look into influencer partnerships to leverage their engaged audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key is to test different messaging, creatives, and targeting to see what resonates best. Start small, analyze the results, and then scale up what's working. With a unique product like this, you have a great opportunity to stand out - just make sure your marketing captures that wow factor.\n",

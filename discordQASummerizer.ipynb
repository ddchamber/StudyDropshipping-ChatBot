You\\'re kind of going with a goofier sound and with this video if I didn\\'t know you I wouldn\\'t even really know it\\'s about the case. Try to create an experience where you open up by reading the hate comment, then right away saying how the case is too strong, luxurious, powerful for anything to harm it. A hook I like better is something like this:\\n\\n\"You think dropping a **X** on the middle of your phone would damage it? Of course not, not with the **X** case.

Most people already have sunglasses which do usually have a certain tint on them. Also do they have other models?\\n\\n---\\n\\nQ: Setting up shipping in Shopify\\nThomasFry: Can someone help me set-up my shipping in my shopify, I am not charging client but my buddy who owns the product distribution has dumped the shipping label and cost on me with shipping charge removal of payment of product. I am confused of how to set this up!\\nThomasFry: no I would never charge for shipping. The business wanted me to purchase all of the shipping labels thru Shopify and take the shipping cost off of the knife purchase from them. BUT it all doesnt matter anymore anyway, this turned into a complete disaster!\\nMikeChamberlin: So you now want to charge for shipping?\\nThomasFry: https://tenor.com/view/tired-groggy-sleepy-what-dazed-gif-16582493918036962522\\nThomasFry: I am creating them today\\nDom Dei: yeah they look fine\\nThomasFry: I was waiting for someone to tell me if I was at least on the right track\\nThomasFry: After a trip through Capcut\\nMikeChamberlin: Looks solid, do you have any close up shots for your other gifs?\\nThomasFry: I went back and started from scratch.\\nThomasFry: yes but you have open like ten of them to find one good one, I will figure it out but it seems like something that should be able to be done in matter of hours is taking me 2 weeks so far\\nDom Dei: oh idk then but there\\'s definitely just some easy ones on the internet right?\\nThomasFry: I am Android, besides I am on my comp\\nDom Dei: It looks like this\\nDom Dei: I honestly just use \"Video to Gif\" from the App Store\\nThomasFry: what software is best for GIF?\\nThomasFry: I recleaned it up\\nThomasFry: I have made the change but it is getting hard to track all these changes. I had to use 3 processes to resize this\\nDom Dei: Yup keep me posted\\nThomasFry: TY I will make that change\\nDom Dei: yeah it\\'s good but ideally we\\'d want to crop the gif so that it\\'s a square. we don\\'t want the gif taking up the entire phone screen as someone\\'s scrolling through the website, a square gets the job done and doesn\\'t feel so crowded on the site\\nThomasFry: is this a good GIF for the description panel ?'"

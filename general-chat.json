You're kind of going with a goofier sound and with this video if I didn't know you I wouldn't even really know it's about the case. Try to create an experience where you open up by reading the hate comment, then right away saying how the case is too strong, luxurious, powerful for anything to harm it. A hook I like better is something like this:\n\n\"You think dropping a **X** on the middle of your phone would damage it? Of course not, not with the **X** case. We've designed the strongest, yet sleekest designed iPhone case which...\"\n\nThen you don't even have to really drop the rock on the phone, you can just hook them in with that hate comment which gets them interested, then just talk about how good your case is and \"forget\" to drop the rock on your phone.

How does auto ds manage that and what would I need to do?\nMikeChamberlin: So this depends on the reason why the customer is asking for a refund. If the product broke or doesn't function right (and it wasn't the customers fault) you would want to just refund them through Shopify. In some cases you could have them send it back (maybe the bought the wrong size) but typically there's no point as the cost to ship it back will be more than the actual product cost. Where it kinda get tricky is when a customer just doesn't like the product or \"decides they don't want it\" after it arrives… Which for me, I will typically just try to explain that they bought it in the first place but refund them if they are really being pain.\nAlex Robinson: Gotcha, so overall it's better to just refund them and not deal with shipping the product back?",

Honestly im sure some poeple in here could be down\nGAP: Yeah that's a great advice, but to be honest I don't have the budget to hire several creators so I want influencers to create 1/2 videos  + the brand is in Italian language so I can't hire here unfortunately\nMikeChamberlin: Influencers are known to charge wayyy to much alot of the time so its mainly a hit or miss meaning you just have to reach out to tons of them\nSlfdspln: I've emailed a couple of big influencers but haven't gotten an email back.\n\nAlso, what's the payment amount we should be giving them for a video?\n\nWhat are your previous experiences?

Like your first sentence is a hook. Your speaking cuts/transitions are fast and precise, wasting no time. You held the $100 bill upside down and then flipped the camera view in post. Boosts interest. Throwing up random graphics that support your words, etc. And within 35 seconds you lay out the plot of the video the viewer is watching. The viewer is left excited to see how it plays out for you\nMikeChamberlin: Yeah not a bad idea at all\nwes calliope: Do you guys think it's a good idea to price a bit higher then whenever there's someone in my comments showing interest I say \"use CODE30 for 30% OFF and free shipping\" so they feel special\nMikeChamberlin: You just dont want the people who dont go the the comments to be turned away because of the price\nMikeChamberlin: New video boys let me know what you think!",

What are some reliable and trustworthy suppliers you've had success with?\n\nUser 2: For dropshipping suppliers, I've had good experiences with Oberlo and Spocket. They have a wide selection of products and decent quality. I'd recommend checking them out.\n\nUser 1: Thanks for the suggestions! I'll definitely look into Oberlo and Spocket. Do you have any other tips for finding good suppliers as a new dropshipper?\n\nUser 3: Another supplier I can recommend is AliExpress. They have millions of products to choose from and the prices are usually pretty low. Just be sure to vet the suppliers carefully and read reviews before placing any orders.\n\nUser 1: Awesome, AliExpress is definitely on my radar too. I've heard mixed things about the quality and reliability of some AliExpress suppliers though. Any advice on how to find the good ones?\n\nUser 2: When using AliExpress, I'd suggest looking at the supplier's ratings, number of orders, and customer reviews. Try to find suppliers with high ratings, lots of orders, and mostly positive reviews. Also, order samples first to check the quality before listing the products.\n\nUser 1: Great tips, thanks so much! I'll make sure to do my due diligence on any AliExpress suppliers. Really appreciate all the helpful advice.",

Turn off any Tracking or Stuff. Dont let tik tok scan your Contacts and see a bunch of Non US Phone Numbers (Better use a phone purely for Organic wich has no Contacts and Stuff & Apps on it beside Tik Tok & VPN)",

    "content": "Q: What kind of profit margins should I expect with dropshipping? I'm just starting out and want to make sure I'm pricing my products correctly.\n\nA: Profit margins in dropshipping can vary quite a bit depending on your niche, products, and pricing strategy. As a general rule of thumb, you'll want to aim for at least a 30-50% profit margin on each sale. This gives you enough room to cover your advertising costs, platform fees, and still make a decent profit.\n\nSome key things to keep in mind:\n- Research your competition and see what kind of margins they're offering. This will give you a good benchmark.\n- Factor in all your costs - product price, shipping, platform fees, advertising, etc. Don't just look at the product cost.\n- Be willing to experiment with pricing. Start on the higher end of the margin range and adjust as needed based on sales and conversion rates.\n- Higher ticket items tend to have lower margins, while lower priced impulse buys can support higher margins.\n\nThe most important thing is to find that sweet spot where you're making good profits but also providing value to your customers. It may take some trial and error, but that's all part of the process when starting a dropshipping business.",

    "content": "Will: how do you source from Startups and Entrepreneurship\n- [Instructor] In this video, we'll discuss startups and entrepreneurship. Startups are new companies or businesses that are typically founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. Startups are often associated with technology, innovation, and rapid growth. Entrepreneurs are individuals who identify a problem or need in the market and create a new business to address that need. Entrepreneurs are often driven by a desire to be their own boss, to create something new, and to make a profit.\n\nStartups and entrepreneurship are closely linked, as startups are typically founded by entrepreneurs. However, not all entrepreneurs start startups, and not all startups are founded by entrepreneurs. Some key characteristics of startups include:\n\n1. Innovation: Startups often develop new products, services, or business models that disrupt existing industries or create new markets.\n\n2. Scalability: Startups are designed to grow rapidly and achieve a large market share, often through the use of technology and innovative business practices.\n\n3. Funding: Startups often require significant funding, often from venture capitalists or angel investors, to finance their growth and development.\n\n4. Risk: Startups are inherently risky, as there is no guarantee of success, and many startups fail within the first few years of operation.\n\nEntrepreneurs, on the other hand, are individuals who possess certain characteristics and skills that enable them to identify and pursue new business opportunities. Some key characteristics of entrepreneurs include:\n\n1. Creativity and innovation: Entrepreneurs are often highly creative and innovative, able to identify new opportunities and develop unique solutions to problems.\n\n2. Risk-taking: Entrepreneurs are willing to take on significant risks in pursuit of their business goals, often investing their own time and money into their ventures.\n\n3. Persistence and resilience: Entrepreneurs must be persistent and resilient in the face of challenges and setbacks, as starting and growing a business can be a difficult and uncertain process.\n\n4. Leadership and decision-making: Entrepreneurs must be able to effectively lead and manage their teams, make critical decisions, and navigate the complexities of running a business.\n\nOverall, startups and entrepreneurship are closely linked, as startups are typically founded by entrepreneurs who are seeking to develop innovative products or services and bring them to market. However, not all entrepreneurs start startups, and not all startups are founded by entrepreneurs. Understanding the key characteristics of both startups and entrepreneurs can help individuals and organizations better navigate the complex and dynamic world of business and innovation.",

(not trying to be harsh just want to actually help) I see you are trying to do the prototype to finished product video but the way you are doing it is very off. You want to have the viewer confused in the start so they stick around and stay and then actually transition into the product **using the right sound.**The filming looks cheap and honestly the effort seems low almost like you got this all filmed and posted within just 30 mins. Id also assume after a month or so you are running a but low on ideas so I really really recommend watching the call recording from yesterday to see how me and dom would get a product going and how we evaluate videos.

Dropshipping can definitely be a bit overwhelming at first, but here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. Start with product research. Take the time to find a profitable niche and products that you think will sell well. Use tools like Google Trends, Oberlo, and AliExpress to help you identify trending products.\n\n2. Build a professional-looking website. Use a platform like Shopify that makes it easy to create an online store. Make sure your site is mobile-friendly and has a clean, user-friendly design.\n\n3. Focus on marketing and advertising. Organic methods like SEO and social media can be great, but don't be afraid to invest in paid ads as well. Facebook and Instagram ads can be very effective for dropshipping.\n\n4. Stay patient and persistent. Building a successful dropshipping business takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results right away. Keep learning, testing, and optimizing your strategy.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific questions!

How are you gonna get them to buy it?\n1roady: People do that here, but they also love convenience.\n\nYou're not looking for those buyers. You're looking for the impulse buyers\nAna-Timea: I'm starting looking for product and if I would have questions I'm coming back 🙂 thank you 😊\nAna-Timea: For sure.. \nbut I'm a little bit worried because the people hier are very skeptical and think they can buy that one product for cheaper than at some ads.. they look up everywhere to see if they find it for cheaper than where they saw it first. \nI don't know.. but fur sure I will give it a try\n1roady: Yes. I tried it, with broken German and my sales broke even with ad spends\nAna-Timea: U mean I should try find a product working in the US and then merket it on German hier in the EU? I'm not sure if I Unterstand 🙈\n1roady: UK has one of the biggest markets. Do some research and see what you want to target. \n\nPeople love websites in their own language and Germany is big in ecom.\n\nWhat about finding a product working in the US and try marketing it to a new market?\nAna-Timea: Ok.. I'm trying! 🙂 \nIm from Austria and latter on.. my sales should be hier in EU , right?\n1roady: Lots of product research methods.\n\nYou can use Tiktok, and sales tracker tools like dropship.io or shophunter to see if its bringing in a good amount of sales.\n\nYou can get a free week trial for Dropship.io and get an idea.\n\nWhen looking ask yourself:\nDoes it have a \"wow\" factor and grab attention?\nDoes it solve a problem?\nCan you mark it up 2-5x?\nEasy to ship/decent shipping times?\nAna-Timea: What should I use to find products?

On the other hand, if people from tiktok are eager to buy my product, then having it on the home page could be beneficial for checkout.\nGrom: I also feel the logo needs work, but couldn't come up with a better idea that fits with my product.\nGrom: Joined the server 4 days ago and started working on my first shop. Here's what I've got at this point: https://butterflybottleopener.com/ . I'm looking for any criticism or any help at all to improve the website. Ordered my product 4 days ago and still awaiting package, but once I receive it, I plan on changing the gifs to original clips.\nGrom: That definitely has potential with proper marketing.
